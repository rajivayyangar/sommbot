Clayton and Alan - Skyroam. 


- Printing shipment labels throughout the day
- Drop-shipping rates from Shenzen
- Change Skyroam's first mile from Fedex to UPS
- Domestic APO/FPO - Ask Linda (USPS)
- 3PL / warehousing 
- Yakit shipping SLA - is unreliable.
	Given a shipment day-of-week,  
- Reviewing inventory mgt systems. 
- Info on Battery - how is their partner doing it? Send pic and email. 
- B2B rates from Shenzen (c.f. Flexport).
- Ability to ship from multiple places to catch a customer's destination or mid-point on a trip. Would like a master account to monitor USA, China, Berlin shipping accounts. 
- We have partners trying to set up rental business all over the world.
	- Shipping for partners. 
- Avi on Skyroam - talk to us about selling on Flipkart. 

Challenge is: Integrating Yakit with warehousing, inventory management. 
	Is there one global warehouse solution, or set of warehouses that use the same inventory mgt software that Skyroam can integrate with. 
	Alan: Ingram micro
	Jaggi: Synnex
	Clayton: Expansis - helps ship stuff to Malaysia and places not on the other ship to list. 

Limited by:
- Indonesia - Yakit doesn't ship to
- mainland china - document issues
- India - document issues
- Mexico - document issues

Agenda
	Drop-ship from China (Shenzen).
	Boxing/consolidation

Right now they use Flexport for over $800, and Yakit for under. 
Jaggi: We can do 


Skyroam - trying to set up US, Europe, and Shenzen shipping centers. 



-----------
China will ship bulk with lithium batteries. 

Battery replacement: Need to ship a new hotspot. 

Jaggi: you may need to stop shipping lithium batteries, and instead send only hotspots with Lithium batteries. 
If you do just lithium batteries, you need to ship is "C" - not by air. 
-----
Use Cases:
1) Skyroam getting batteries from the factory.
2) Customers travelling abroad needing batteries. 

How to get people replacement batteries faster? They have a non-standard lithium battery, and the last batch had quality issues - not holding charge. 

E.g. As a Skyroam customer, I have a 12-day business trip, and I'm leaving in 1 day, and I need a new battery or new hotspot. How quickly can you get that to me? 
--> Yakit can only do Express in 2-5 days. Not fast enough. 
--> So... need stocks in Berlin/EU, US, Asia. 

Need warehouses to house stuff, and do returns. 
- We have some 3rd party fulfillment companies. Some quite big. 

Want the 3rd party to:
1) store devices
2) take returns and bulk ship to US for QA or China.
3) do larger orders through Flexport
4) do smaller orders 

Would like a 3PF that's trained on Yakit. 

Flexport: 
	nice interface that we can add people to. 
	nice interface for importing. 
	Clayton: give us a price estimate. 
	They want to integrate them with Fishbowl / Cin7 (inventory mgt - right now using spreadsheets). 
	Flexport allows people to use it in China and Germany - has training. And also has training and easy ability to add teams. 
	Flexport was cheap customs brokerage - $240/year (already paid a one-time brokerage fee). 
	Flexport is importer of record. 
		Yakit could
	Yakit process is better - Clayton says they haven't done a shipment with Flexport in the way Flexport wants. 
		Yakit is 'EXW'?
	Flexport has prettier tracking and a bit easier to use, the first time. 
	Inventory mgt software: 
		Fishbowl and Cin7 - integrates with Amazon, Shopify, notably Quickbooks online
Integration with Amazon will be important for domestic.

Fedex Ground pickup is not happening.
